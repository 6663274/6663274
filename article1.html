<h1>Animal rights group responds to sentence in dog beating case</h1>

<p>
BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (NEWSCHANNEL 3) - A Battle Creek man convicted last month of animal abuse is headed to prison.
</p>

<p>
On Friday, David Hursley was sentenced to a minimum of three years and ten months to a maximum of 15 years in a state prison.
</p>

<p>
In September he was convicted of animal cruelty after beating a dog with a baseball bat, then shooting it with a pellet gun back in February.
</p>

<p>
Prosecutors say Hursley showed little remorse as he heard his fate Friday. The Calhoun County assistant prosecutor says this case should be an example that this behavior won't be tolerated, and those who commit such abuse should be held accountable.
</p>

<p>
"It was showing the side of a person who was taking control, abusing and beating an innocent animal who couldn't fend for itself; it was just begging for food," said Sherrie Wilson, with the Animal Rescue Project, in Kalamazoo, which helps rescue and provide homes for about 750 cats and dogs each year.
</p>

<p>
Wilson has been involved with Hursley's case since day one.
</p>

<p>
"We were writing letters and contacting the prosecutor's office," she said.
</p>

<p>
In February, Hursley told police the dog he was watching, named Obie, was aggressive and bit his friend, so he beat the dog with his fists and a bat, then shot it in the head with an airsoft gun.
</p>

<p>
A responding police officer shot and killed Obie because he was so badly hurt.
</p>

<p>
Hursley's defense attorney told the judge the case has been about emotion rather than the law, calling it a property crime, because he says the dog is not a human being.
</p>

<p>
"We got a little upset," Wilson said. "We didn't want to hear that, because of the way it was handled."
</p>

<p>
In a statement, Calhoun County Prosecutor David Gilbert said: "it was a fair sentence. I don't believe the judge or jury acted out of emotion. The bottom line is that dog was brutally beaten for no reason."
</p>

<p>
The prosecution says Hursley's previous criminal history, which includes drunken driving, domestic violence, and assault convictions, played a role in his sentence.
</p>

<p>
"We were really really shocked. We knew then for sure this was the right decision to send him to prison," said Wilson.
</p>

<p>
The prosecutor says Hursley apologized in court Friday, saying everything happened in just seconds.
</p>

<p>
We reached out to his attorney for a comment. He did not return our call.
