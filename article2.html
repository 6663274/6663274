<h1>Animal Rights Group PETA Asks Centre Not To Lift Ban On Jallikattu</h1>

<p>
New Delhi:  Amid reports that the Centre is planning to allow popular bull taming sport 'Jallikattu', animal rights body PETA today said that the ban should not be withdrawn and that it will hold a protest at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday.
</p>

<p>
PETA or People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals India said that two giant inflatable bulls will run beside PETA supporters in a "bloodless Jallikattu" to protest the government's reported intention to lift the ban on such bull races and bullfights.
</p>

<p>
"India must not turn back the clock and allow bulls to be tormented and killed. The world is watching and hoping that the government of India will do the right thing by keeping these dangerous and cruel spectacles illegal," said PETA India Chief Executive Officer Poorva Joshipura.
</p>

<p>
PETA India said that there are reports that the Environment Ministry plans to amend The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, to allow these cruel spectacles despite Supreme Court banning them.
</p>

<p>
The animal rights body said that the court's 2014 ruling stated that cruelty is inherent in these events, as bulls are not anatomically suited for such activities and making them participate, causing them unnecessary pain and suffering.
</p>

<p>
However, on January 7, 2016, the Environment Ministry attempted to overturn the ban through a Gazette notification.
</p>

<p>
The notification was later challenged by PETA India and other animal-protection groups, and it was stayed by the court, meaning Jallikattu and similar events cannot currently be held.
</p>

<p>
The final hearing of the case is expected to take place on November 9, PETA India said in a statement.
</p>

<p>
PETA India has documented that terrified bulls are often deliberately given substances like alcohol in order to disorient them and that their tails twisted and bitten.
</p>

<p>
They are also stabbed and jabbed with sickles, spears, knives, or sticks and are punched, jumped on, and dragged to the ground while three bulls even died during Jallikattu events in 2014.
</p>

<p>
"When Jallikattu was permitted in the past, hundreds of human participants were injured each year and many were killed. Between 2010 and 2014, approximately 1,100 injuries to humans were reported by the media as a result of cruel and dangerous Jallikattu-type events and 17 people died - including a child," it said.
