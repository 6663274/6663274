<h1>Moby's Circle V Fest Puts Spotlight On Veganism And Animal Rights</h1>

<p>
Between 1999’s Play and 2002’s 18, electronic music icon Moby sold over 15,000,000 copies worldwide. Once you have achieved that level of success there is a built-in live audience, but Moby is emphatic he does not want to tour again.
</p>

<p>
“The thought of it makes me cringe,” he says. “I love playing music, but I’m honestly just as happy playing Johnny Cash songs in my living room with friends as I am standing on stage in front of a lot of people.”
</p>

<p>
He did take the stage the other night in L.A. though to headline the first Circle V Festival, a celebration of veganism and animal rights that raised $80,000 for Mercy For Animals. In between acts that included Cold Cave and Blaqk Audio, an electronic project from AFI’s Davey Havok and Jade Puget, organizers joked about doing it next year with Morrissey headlining, then growing the year after to have the world’s most famous vegan musician, Paul McCartney, headline.
</p>

<p>
Even before he knew how much money was raised, Moby already considered the event a success and was on board for 2017. “Everything about it worked out, it happened, we were able to find a venue, we have Goldenvoice as our partner, we’ve got all the vendors, we’ve got the speakers, we’ve got the food people, all the bands and DJs, so the very fact it worked out is great,” he says.
</p>

<p>
Playing for something he believes in is the only reason to consider touring in any form anymore So he might relent on his no touring policy to take Circle V to other cities in the future. “That’s about the only thing that could get me to think of going on the road again, if it was in service of a cause that I cared about,” he says. “If it’s just another middle-aged musician going on tour for the thirtieth time, clearly that doesn’t need to happen, it’s happened enough for everybody.”
</p>

<p>
One of the tricks of any benefit show is to make your point about your cause without being too heavy handed. And animal rights is an issue where people have strong opinions on both sides. Morrissey, for example, has been known to show a film on slaughter houses during his live shows.
</p>

<p>
Havok fully supports the film. “I love and respect Morrissey for showing the slaughterhouse videos to his fans for multiple reasons,” he says. “I think, as humans, we should be confronted with it. I think it’s even more commendable he does it because he knows how influential he is in regards to his fan base. Certainly a vast amount of people love and respect the music of Morrissey and I think Morrissey’s voice is more strongly heard by the people who follow him. It’s a brave thing to do on his part to show it because it upsets people, it is upsetting and it should be upsetting because most people don’t want to see animals slaughtered.”
</p>

<p>
Moby also understands that inclination to drive your point home forcefully, even if it upsets people. “Every activist, at some point you want to scream, you see the world is broken and you want to yell at people, just yell at them until they fix the world,” he says. “The problem with that is it’s human nature if someone’s yelling at you, you just get mad and get defensive. At the core of it, you need to present messages to people with respect. One, it makes the activism more effective. Two, it’s just basic human decency. It’s violently presumptuous to tell somebody they should believe what you believe.”
</p>

<p>
That approach of presenting messages with respect is the one he wants to take with Circle V. “This festival is all about attraction. There’s a promotional element, but we wanted beautiful food, we wanted beautiful clothes and music and great bands. We’re not showing video tape of baby chickens being slaughtered,” he says. “Everyone knows that exists, everyone has seen that. If that was an effective tool to use, we would use it. Let people find that on their own, I feel like this is a little more attraction than promotion.”
